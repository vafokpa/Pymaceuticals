  <h2>About The Project</h2>
  <p>As you can see, you want to take Capumolin. Graphs don't lie. This was a project done for the Matplotlib section of the course. This was an interesting project because we got to proactice data manipulation and data visualization. Out of the 4 drugs that you see, Capumolin was the only one that resulted in a negative delta regarding the size of the tumor</p>
